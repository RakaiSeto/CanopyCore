# This is Canopy!
## The Background
In my SHS, many students lies to their parents about their attendance. They would depart from their home, but would never arrive to school. Instead, they would go to bike workshop (bengkel) or sketchy kiosk to smoke, gamble, drink alcohol, play games, or even use drugs.

## Introducing Canopy!!
Canopy is an innovative system that digitalise school attendance system by using qrcode to record student attendance. And the bonus is, said student's parents can **see** their child attendance record.

We just need students to install the Canopy mobile app, and the school to install our barcode scanner on school lobby/gate, and voila, you have digitalise your school's attendance system. It's a **cheap** and **effective** system for parents and school to track the students attendance and preventing them from skipping school. 

## Our Goals
Our goals is to make Indonesian students more discipline and involve parents in overseeing their child's school attendance. I hope this system can help create a better school system in Indonesia
